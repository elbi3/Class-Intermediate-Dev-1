# TextWise Solutions | Recursion

*Background:*
TextWise Solutions is in the process of enhancing "ContentOptimizer," their leading content analysis tool, by integrating a feature that requires reversing strings as part of its text manipulation functionalities. This task is particularly crucial for developing a sophisticated algorithm that can analyze sentence structures and suggest stylistic improvements. The development team has decided to implement this feature using recursive methods for several strategic reasons:

1. Educational Value: Incorporating recursion teaches the engineering team and any new hires the importance of understanding fundamental computer science concepts, fostering a culture of continuous learning and skill development.
2. Code Readability and Maintainability: Recursion can lead to solutions that are cleaner and more readable for some problems, making the codebase easier to maintain and understand.
3. Algorithmic Efficiency: For certain text processing tasks, recursive solutions might offer elegant and efficient approaches, especially when dealing with complex data structures or operations that have a natural recursive definition, such as parsing nested structures.
 

## Technical Requirements:

The string reversal function must be implemented using recursion to demonstrate the engineering team's ability to apply fundamental computer science principles in developing practical solutions.

## Objective:

As a candidate interviewing for a software engineering position at TextWise Solutions, you are tasked to implement the string reversal function using recursion


## Code Submission Requirements:

- Submit a link to your Github repository
- Github repository should contain 
    1. Diagrams or flowcharts that can help you and the interviewer stay on the same page
    2. Clarifying questions
    3. Test cases using unit test frameworks. You should have test cases for normal cases as well as edge cases (we expect you to have at least 3 test cases testing normal cases and at least 3 test cases testing edge cases)
    4. Time and Space complexity of your solution. 

## Presentation Requirements: 
code & diagram
present test cases and demonstrate that you are passing those cases: 3 test cases testing normal cases, and 3 test cases testing edge cases
You need to present Time and Space complexity of your solution. 
refine your solution to improve its time and space efficiency.
Explain the trade-offs and how the optimization improves the original solution.
