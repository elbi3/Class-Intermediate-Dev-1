# we hope number of tickets in, is number tickets out
# what happens if there's no tickets?
# no timestamp? or check if class has both attributes? 
# base ticket order on number, since that's the order printed (some timestamps can be the same)
# 0-99, then flips back to 0?
# validation-does the class have the right number, and timestamp?
# test if datetime format is correct,
# generate ticket & timestamp at same time and compare timestamps?
